# Simple-e-Commerce-Website-using-React
The main features includes:
- App Header with Menu and view cart button 
- App Footer with static links
- App routing using react-router-dom
- API integration to fetch data from server
- Show list of cards/e-commerce products with their details/actions

I have used dummy json to fetch the shopping website data
